# Components and classes

This section describes the attributes of each components.

**Be sure to read** [YAPG template syntax](serialization-format.md) **before continuing your
reading.**

## Vocabulary

In the attribute's tables below:

-   the **"U"** column tells if the attributes can be unserialized from YAPG templates files
-   the **"R"** column tells if the attributes can be received or
    changed at runtime with `a_component(entity).attr_name`
    and `a_component(entity).attr_name = value` syntaxes. See
    [Lua runtime](lua.md) to see how to get/change attributes' values of components during
    runtime.
-   the **"P"** column tells if the attributes can be used as a template
    parameter.

"✓" means "yes", "…" means that it will be included in a future version
(planned) and nothing means "no".

Currently, the game has the following components:

-   [CollidableComponent](#collidablecomponent)
-   [ColliderComponent](#collidercomponent)
-   [CustomBehaviorComponent](#custombehaviorcomponent)
-   [CustomDataComponent](#customdatacomponent)
-   [FinishLineComponent](#finishlinecomponent)
-   [HitboxComponent](#hitboxcomponent)
-   [PlatformComponent](#platformcomponent)
-   [PlatformerComponent](#platformercomponent)
-   [PlayerComponent](#playercomponent)
-   [PositionComponent](#positioncomponent)
-   [RenderComponent](#rendercomponent)

## CollidableComponent

Component that allows an entity to react to collisions with multiple polygons.

Name | Type | Description | [U](#vocabulary) | [R](#vocabulary)
-----|------|-------------|------------------|-----------------
polygons | Map associating string to [polygon_callback](#polygon_callback-class) | The string is the polygon's name. | ✓ |

### polygon_callback class

Represents a polygon with its associated callbacks (used by CollidableComponent to allow scripting on collisions)

Name | Type | Description | [U](#vocabulary) | [R](#vocabulary)
-----|------|-------------|------------------|-----------------
polygon | [polygon](#polygon-class) | The polygon | ✓ | ✓
exclusive | boolean | Whether the following polygon_callback will be ignored if this one collides | ✓ |
on_collision_begin | A function, two args: the entity itself and the other colliding entity | A function called when the collision starts | ✓ |
on_collision_end | A function, two args: the entity itself and the other colliding entity | A function called when the collision ends | ✓ |
collides | A function, two args: the entity itself and the other colliding entity | A function called each frame while the collision still exists. | ✓ |

## ColliderComponent

Component that allows the object to trigger collisions with entities with CollidableComponent.

Alone, it will not work as it needs the entity to have a CollidableComponent to store at least one hitbox

## CustomBehaviorComponent

Component that allows a lua callback function to be called at each frames.

### Attributes

Name | Type | Description | [U](#vocabulary) | [R](#vocabulary) | [P](#vocabulary)
-----|------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------
on_update | function | A function called each frame with two arguments : entity and dt (the time since the previous frame). | ✓ | |

### Lua serialization

```lua
components = {
    --The CustomBehaviorComponent
    ["custom_behavior"] = {
        on_update = function(entity, dt)
            --act on the entity
        end,
    },
}
```

## CustomDataComponent

This is a special component, see [Lua runtime > Per entity instance storage](lua.md#per-entity-instance-storage) to understand how it should be used.

## FinishLineComponent

*Not documented yet.*

## HitboxComponent

Contains an polygonal hitbox (must be convex). Used to detect collisions between platformer
entities and platforms and collisions between collider entities and collidable entities.

### Attributes

Name | Type | Description | [U](#vocabulary) | [R](#vocabulary) | [P](#vocabulary)
-----|------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------
polygon | polygon | The hitbox convex polygon | ✓ | ✓ |

### Lua serialization

```lua
components = {
    --The HitboxComponent
    ["hitbox"] = {
        --this is a square hitbox
        polygon = {
            points = {
                {
                    x = 0,
                    y = 0
                },
                {
                    x = 64,
                    y = 0
                },
                {
                    x = 64,
                    y = 64
                },
                {
                    x = 0,
                    y = 64
                },
            }
        },
    },
}
```

## PlatformComponent

Declares and entity as a platform on which the entities with the `PlatformerComponent` can walk and jump.

### Attributes

Name | Type | Description | [U](#vocabulary) | [R](#vocabulary) | [P](#vocabulary)
-----|------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------
activated | bool | activates or not the platform collision with entities | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
platform_type | string | `"Platform"` for solid platforms or `"Jumpthru"` for platforms that the platformer entities can pass through from underneath. | ✓ | |

## PlatformerComponent

Declares an entity as affected by the gravity and that it can walk and jump on platforms.

*Note: it doesn't mean the entity is controlled by a player, need to use PlayerComponent
in addition for that. So, items moving on the ground can use the PlatformerComponent too.*

**Warning: when trying to move an entity with this component in a lua callback function,
consider setting `wants_to_jump`, `wants_to_go_left` and `wants_to_go_right` attributes
of this component to make it move (instead of changing it position).**
